intel-npu-firmware-headers for Debian
--------------------------

The source for this package is https://github.com/intel/linux-npu-driver. 
The reason for this is that the vpux-elf package depends on headers in 
linux-npu-driver, but linux-npu-driver depends on the vpux-elf package.
The solution at this time is to package those headers into their own package 
first
